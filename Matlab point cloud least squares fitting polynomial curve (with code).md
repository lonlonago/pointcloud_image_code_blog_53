#  I. Overview 

##  1. Algorithm overview 

   The polyfit function is a polynomial curve fit. For polynomials, the polynomial coefficients are:. 

##  2. Main functions

    Returns the coefficients of a polynomial of order, which is the best fit of the least squares method in the data. The coefficients in are arranged by power, and the length is.

   It also returns a structure S that can be used as input to a polyval to obtain an error estimate.

  ```  
   Also returns, the latter is a two-element vector containing the centered and scaled values. Is mean (x), is std (x). When using these values, polyfit places the center of, at the zero value and scales to have the unit standard deviation  

   This centralization and scaling transformation can simultaneously improve the numerical properties of polynomials and fitting algorithms.
