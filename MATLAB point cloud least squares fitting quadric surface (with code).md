#  First, the principle of the algorithm 

##  1. Overview of the principle 

   The quadric surface equation is as follows: the least squares method is used to fit the local quadric surface, and the objective function is established as: the joint vertical equation (1) and the equation (2), the linear equation system is obtained, see the equation (3), the linear equation system is solved, and the local quadric fitting surface equation is obtained.
