#  First, the principle of the algorithm 

##  1. Algorithm overview 

   The basic idea is to calculate the transformation matrix by randomly sampling a certain number of point pairs, and then use the transformation matrix to transform the source point cloud into the target point cloud coordinate system to calculate the error between the transformed point cloud and the target point cloud. If the error is less than a certain threshold, these point pairs are determined to be inner points, otherwise they are determined to be outer points. Then randomly sample a set of point pairs and repeat the above steps until the optimal transformation matrix satisfying a certain proportion of inner points is found.
