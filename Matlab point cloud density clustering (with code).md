  ```  
    The DBSCAN algorithm is used to cluster the observations in the data matrix. dbscan clusters the observations (or points) based on the threshold of the neighborhood search radius and the minimum number of neighbors required to identify the core points. The function returns an index vector containing the cluster index for each observation.
