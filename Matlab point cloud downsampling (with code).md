#  First, the sampling method 

##   1. Voxel downsampling 

  ```python

  ```  
 Use a voxel filter to return to the downsampled point cloud. 

##   2. Random downsampling 

  ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574578032
  ```  
 Returns a downsampled point cloud with random sampling that does not require substitution. 

##   3. Non-uniform downsampling 

  ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574578032
  ```  
 Uses a non-uniform voxel filter to return a downsampled point cloud. This method selects a random point from each box. If no normals are provided in the input point cloud, this method will automatically populate the Normal property in the ptCloudOut output.
