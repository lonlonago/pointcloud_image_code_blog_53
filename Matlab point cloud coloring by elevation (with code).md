#  First, the principle of the algorithm 

   First, the elevation extremum (including the maximum and minimum elevation) of the point cloud is obtained according to the Z-axis direction, and then the elevation is normalized to the range of 0~ 255. Finally, the colormap color rendering function in matlab is used to color and save the rendering result to the point cloud.
